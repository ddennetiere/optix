*      \defgroup globalc  Interface C functions
*      \brief Functions exported by the C interface
*
*
*      \defgroup elemClasses Instantiable optical elements classes
*      \brief  The limited list of class names which can be used to create optical elements in OptiX
*
*       The CreateElement() function of the C interface and the C++ internal function CreateElementObject() recognize two names for each instantiable optical element class.
*       A template style name, Name<class1[,class2]>, or a capitalized name with internal capital letters (camel case).
*       The GetElementType() C function calls ElementBase::getOptixClass(), and  always returns the template style name.
*
*       The actual underlying class is not always templated. When it is a template the template style name is the internal class name, and the simple name is a C++ typedef.
*       When the underlying class is not templated, e.g. case of sources, the templated style name is an alias only recognized by the CreateElement() / CreateElementObject() functions.

*
*      <H1>  General information on the Aperture API </H1>
*
*   Any Element based on a Surface class has an ApertureStop member, which is composed of an array of superimposed stopping \ref Region Regions or Stops;\n
*   * Each Region is a simply connected domain, which can be either a Polygon or an Ellipse.\n
*       \e Mind that no check is made on the simply connected character of a polygon when created
*   * The optical transmittance associated  to a Region is defined by the Opacity boolean parameter of the interface functions.
*       - if Opacity=true, the transmittance  is 0 inside the Region, and it is 1. outside;*
*       - if Opacity=false, The transmittance is 1. inside the Region, and 0. outside.
*   * The transmittance of the aperture is a logical combination of the opacities of the successive Regions or Stops.
*       - if the (inside) opacity of the added Region is 0, it combines with the total opacity of the underlying Regions with a OR (||) operator.
*       - if the (inside) opacity of the added Region is 1, it combines with the total opacity of the underlying Regions with a AND (&&) operator.
*
*       In other words,  adding an opaque Region obstruct the transmission under the region area \n
*       while adding a transparent Region opens an aperture though all the stacked stops . This is intended to allow rounding of squared apertures.
*
*   All functions of the Aperture API are returning a size_t value. A negative return value, actually -1, means an error occurred and the GetOptiXLastError can be checked for a reason.
