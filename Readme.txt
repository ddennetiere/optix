This is a ray-tracer library for X-ray optics.
All function are exposed in C form, thow it is internally written in C++

June 23, 2021:
New surface shape classes have been added: 
ConicBaseCylinder  implements any conic based cylinder (elliptical, hyperbolic, and parabolic cylinders)
RevolutionQuadric implements  revolution quadrics (ellipsoid, hyperboloid, a paraboloid).
These shapes are only available with mirrors but could be used with gratings or films if really needed. 

Compilation requires that ConicBaseCylinder.cpp and RevolutionQuadric.cpp are added to project configuration files for targets debug, release, test, and test(release)

WARNING - Starting from May 5, 2021  system can be saved in XML text format
 For this aim, it must now be linked to libxml2-2
 You can add libxml2.a to the linked libraries and addd path to libxml2-2\include\libxml2 for compilation, 
 libxml2-2\lib for linking and ..\libxml2-2\bin for execution  (both last 2 in the Linker search  tab for CB users)
